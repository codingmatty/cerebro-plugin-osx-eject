> [Cerebro](https://cerebroapp.com) plugin to eject mounted volumes in macOS

![](screenshot.png)

## Usage

In Cerebro, type eject and select volume to eject.

It uses diskutil to list and unmount volumes.

## Installing

* Type `plugins eject` into Cerebro
* Click `install`

## Motivation

This plugin was inspired by the similar Alfred Workflow.
Some things the need to be implemented include showing a preview, since the text gets cut off in the list; also be able to make this work for windows as well.
